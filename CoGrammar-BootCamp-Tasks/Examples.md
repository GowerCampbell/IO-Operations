### Add Headers to the File
Adds headers to the file for student names and IDs.

### Loop Through Each Student
Loops through each student to collect their details.

### Ask for Student Name
Prompts the user to enter the student's full name.

### Exit Option
Provides an option to exit the registration process.

### Process Student Name
Processes the student's name to generate initials.

### Generate Random ID
Generates a random 6-digit ID for the student.

### Write Student Details to the File
Writes the student's name and ID to the file.

### Print Confirmation
Prints a confirmation message after registration.

### Reflections and Questions
Reflections on the code and questions for improvement.

## dob_task.py

### Program Objective
Demonstrate the ability to work with file handling, data extraction, and formatted output in Python. The program reads and extracts data from a text file (`DoB.txt`) and organizes it into two sections: 'Name' and 'Birth'.

### Initialize Variables
Initializes variables to store extracted names and birth dates.

### Open File & Read Contents
Opens the `DoB.txt` file and reads its contents.

### Reading Each Line in the File
Reads each line in the file one by one.

### Splitting Each Line into Three Parts
Splits each line into three parts: first name, last name, and birthdate.

### Correct Format?
Checks if the line has the correct format.

### Appending Name & DoB to Lists
Appends the extracted names and birth dates to their respective lists.

### Printing Results
Prints the extracted names and birth dates.

### Reflections and Questions
Reflections on the code and questions for improvement.
