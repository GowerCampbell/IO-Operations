## Writing to Files in Python

### Using the `open()` Function
Python provides the built-in `open()` function to work with files. When writing to a file, you need to specify an appropriate mode:

| Mode  | Description |
|-------|------------|
| `w`   | Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist, and overwrites existing content. |
| `w+`  | Opens a file for writing and reading. Creates a new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist and overwrites existing content. |
| `a`   | Opens a file for appending. Creates a new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist and adds new content at the end of the file. |
| `a+`  | Opens a file for appending and reading. Creates a new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist and adds new content at the end of the file. |

### Writing Data to a File
#### Using `w` Mode
The `w` mode writes data to a file, replacing any existing content.
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(name + "\n")
    file.write("This is a new line of text.\n")
```
üí° **Tip:** If you run this code multiple times, it will overwrite `output.txt` each time.

#### Using `a` Mode (Appending Data)
The `a` mode allows you to add new data to an existing file without overwriting it.
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(name + "\n")
    file.write("This text is appended at the end.\n")
```
üí° **Tip:** This mode is useful for maintaining logs or adding new entries without deleting previous data.

### Writing Multiple Lines
To write multiple lines efficiently, use a list and `writelines()`:
```python
lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

### Ensuring Proper File Handling
When using `open()`, you should always close the file to free system resources. However, using the `with` statement automatically handles closing for you:
```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
# File is closed automatically after the block ends
```

### Handling Encoding
If your file contains special characters, specify the encoding to avoid errors:
```python
with open("output.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    file.write("„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ\n")  # Writing Japanese characters
```

### Summary
‚úÖ Use `w` mode to write and overwrite files.
‚úÖ Use `a` mode to append content.
‚úÖ Always use `with open()` to manage file resources efficiently.
‚úÖ Specify `encoding="utf-8"` when working with non-ASCII characters.
