## **üìÇ Reading from Files in Python**  

Reading from files is a fundamental operation in Python when working with text or data files. Below, we'll cover different methods and best practices for reading files, including handling file paths and directories.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `open()` and `with` Statements**  
Python's `open()` function allows us to work with files efficiently. The `with` statement ensures the file is closed properly after it's used.

### **‚úÖ Best Practice: Using `with open()`**  
```python
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Read entire file content
print(content)
```
- The `with` statement **automatically** closes the file after execution.
- `encoding="utf-8"` ensures that special characters are handled correctly.
- `"r"` mode means **read mode** (default).

### **‚ùå Avoid: Manually Closing Files**  
```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()  # Must remember to close the file manually
```
- Forgetting `file.close()` can lead to **memory leaks** or file locking issues.

## **2 Looping Through File Lines**  
Instead of reading an entire file at once, it's often better to loop through it **line by line**, especially for large files.

### ** Example: Looping Through Lines**
```python
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # `strip()` removes extra whitespace and newlines
```
- **Efficient:** Reads one line at a time, reducing memory usage.
- **Useful for large files** to avoid loading everything into memory.

## **3 Using `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`**  
Python provides multiple ways to read files.

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `read(size)` | Reads the entire file or up to `size` bytes | `file.read(10)` (Reads first 10 bytes) |
| `readline()` | Reads one line at a time | `file.readline()` |
| `readlines()` | Reads all lines into a list | `file.readlines()` |

### ** Example Usage**
```python
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    first_10_chars = file.read(10)  # Read first 10 characters
    print("First 10 characters:", first_10_chars)

    first_line = file.readline()  # Read the next line
    print("First line:", first_line.strip())

    all_lines = file.readlines()  # Read remaining lines into a list
    print("All remaining lines:", all_lines)
```

** When to Use Each Method?**
- `read()` ‚Üí When you need the entire file or a portion of it.
- `readline()` ‚Üí When reading files **line by line** interactively.
- `readlines()` ‚Üí When you want **all lines as a list** (useful for small files).

## **4Ô∏è Handling File Paths and Directories**  
Python allows working with files in different **directories (folders)** using absolute and relative paths.

### **üîç Absolute vs. Relative Paths**
| Path Type | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Absolute Path** | `"C:/Users/John/Documents/example.txt"` | Full path from the root directory |
| **Relative Path** | `"example.txt"` | Assumes file is in the **same directory** as the script |

### **üìå Example: Using `os` and `pathlib` for File Paths**
```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()
print("Current Directory:", cwd)

# Construct a file path using os.path
file_path = os.path.join(cwd, "data", "example.txt")
print("Full File Path:", file_path)

# Check if the file exists
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        print(file.read())
else:
    print("File not found!")
```

** Best Practice: Use `pathlib` (Python 3.6+)**  
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Define file path
file_path = Path("data/example.txt")

# Check if the file exists before reading
if file_path.exists():
    with file_path.open("r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        print(file.read())
else:
    print("File not found!")
```
- `pathlib` is **modern** and works across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## ** Summary & Best Practices**
‚úÖ **Always use `with open()`** to ensure files close properly.  
‚úÖ **Use `for line in file`** for large files to reduce memory usage.  
‚úÖ **Specify `encoding="utf-8"`** to avoid character decoding issues.  
‚úÖ **Use `os` or `pathlib`** to handle file paths dynamically.
